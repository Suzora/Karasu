# Add project specific ProGuard rules here.

# If your project uses WebView with JS, uncomment the following
# and specify the fully qualified class name to the JavaScript interface
# class:
#-keepclassmembers class fqcn.of.javascript.interface.for.webview {
#   public *;
#}

# Uncomment this to preserve the line number information for
# debugging stack traces.
#-keepattributes SourceFile,LineNumberTable

# If you keep the line number information, uncomment this to
# hide the original source file name.
#-renamesourcefileattribute SourceFile

# Hand-added (init does not regenerate this file's content, but keep the note
# anyway): TokenCipher is reached from Rust over JNI by name — minification
# renaming or stripping it fails only at runtime, as a failed sign-in.
-keep class dev.kyu.karasu.TokenCipher { *; }

# The background notification job. NotifScheduler is the load-bearing one:
# it is reached from Rust over JNI by name, has no native methods and no
# manifest entry, so *neither* default keep rule protects it — the same
# runtime-only failure mode TokenCipher's note describes. KarasuNative and
# the JobService are covered by defaults (native methods / manifest), kept
# explicitly anyway so a default-rule change cannot break them silently.
-keep class dev.kyu.karasu.NotifScheduler { *; }
-keep class dev.kyu.karasu.KarasuNative { *; }
-keep class dev.kyu.karasu.NotifJobService { *; }

# The tracking service. TrackingControl shares NotifScheduler's failure mode
# (JNI-by-name, nothing else keeps it); the service is manifest-kept but
# pinned anyway, for the same reason as the JobService above.
-keep class dev.kyu.karasu.TrackingControl { *; }
-keep class dev.kyu.karasu.TrackingService { *; }

# The widgets. WidgetRefresher shares NotifScheduler's failure mode
# (JNI-by-name, nothing else keeps it); the receivers are manifest-kept by
# aapt but pinned anyway so a default-rule change cannot break them silently.
-keep class dev.kyu.karasu.WidgetRefresher { *; }
-keep class dev.kyu.karasu.Widgets$* { *; }

# The in-app updater. UpdateInstaller shares NotifScheduler's failure mode
# (JNI-by-name, nothing else keeps it).
-keep class dev.kyu.karasu.UpdateInstaller { *; }

# The system accent. SystemAccent shares NotifScheduler's failure mode
# (JNI-by-name, nothing else keeps it).
-keep class dev.kyu.karasu.SystemAccent { *; }

# The system bars. SystemBars shares NotifScheduler's failure mode
# (JNI-by-name, nothing else keeps it).
-keep class dev.kyu.karasu.SystemBars { *; }
