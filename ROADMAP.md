# Roadmap

**The complete list of what stands between the tree and the next milestone —
and nothing else.** This file is maintained by deletion: an item that ships
is removed, not annotated, and history lives where history already lives
(commit subjects, and CHANGELOG.md's tag-time curation). Settled decisions
and their reasons are CLAUDE.md's job. If an item is neither open work nor a
decision the next milestone waits on, it does not belong here.

**This file is not `CHANGELOG.md`, on purpose.** `scripts/release/release-notes.ps1`
slices that file between `## <version>` and the next `## `, so a stray heading
there truncates a published release body. Open work goes here; shipped work
goes there, at tag time.

For what will *never* be built, see the "Explicitly rejected" section of
`CLAUDE.md` — activity and playback-history expansion, manga cost tracking,
settings cloud-sync, Plex and Emby, RSS/torrent release feeds, and anything
needing a hosted backend.

## Before the stores

Flathub and F-Droid are submitted with the next Stable, whose date is not
set (maintainer, 2026-10-05). What stands between the tree and the two
requests, each detailed in its `packaging/*/SUBMISSION.md`:

- **F-Droid's own build of the recipe.** The update check, the Node pin, the
  scanner's four deletions, the `NonFreeNet` label and the rewritemeta form are
  settled and checked locally; the whole recipe, the Gradle wrapper's stand-in
  above all, runs only on F-Droid's build server after the submission.

## After v1.32.0

v1.0.0 was tagged on 2026-09-05 and v1.32.0, the next Stable, on
2026-10-03. The backlog, each item with its recorded reason:

### Carried over from the release audit

The audit's own reports are gone (they were a list of unfixed weaknesses in a
repository about to be public, which is a finding it raised against itself).
Everything it found at P1 and P2 is fixed, as is every P3 with a behavioural
consequence. What is left is recorded here rather than in a deleted folder:

Everything still listed here is blocked on something no amount of work in the
repository supplies — a device, a live API, or a decision that is the
maintainer's. Each says which, so none of them reads as unstarted work.

**Needs a user, or a decision already made:**

- **User-installed CAs on Android** — the webpki-roots trade documented in
  `net.rs`. Revisit only if a user with such a setup actually asks.
- **`MediaSessionManager` detection on Android** — moot while the app is
  sideloaded: the notification-listener permission is a Play policy
  question, and Play distribution is itself not planned (maintainer,
  August 2026; sideload is the model, and since 1.11 the app fetches its
  own APK from the GitHub release — see "The Android updater" in
  CLAUDE.md).
