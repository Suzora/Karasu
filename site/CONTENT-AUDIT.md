# Content audit

Every claim the site makes, and what in the repository makes it true. A
sentence with no row here does not go on the page; a row whose evidence
moves takes the sentence with it. Paths are relative to the repository root;
the file names are what a row points at, and a row whose file moves is
rewritten with it. The site describes `main` (the Nightly), not only the
newest tag; where a feature is newer than the Stable download, the row
names the version that shipped it.

Status: **confirmed** (read in the code), **partial** (true with the stated
limit, and the page states it), **mock** (a drawn stand-in, labelled as
such in the code and showing no invented data).

## Hero, trust strip, footer

| # | Claim on the page | Evidence | Status |

## The problem, and how it works

| # | Claim | Evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 12 | Sources: system media sessions, player or browser window, an mpv pipe, your own Jellyfin server | `src-tauri/src/playback/detection/mod.rs` (`detect_playback` order: mpv IPC → Jellyfin → windows → media sessions); `media_session/smtc.rs`, `media_session/mpris.rs`, `mpv_ipc.rs`, `jellyfin.rs` | confirmed |
| 13 | "A scrobble can raise your progress, never lower it, and it re-checks your list a moment before it writes." | `scrobbler.rs` `would_regress` and the pre-write re-check against the live cache (`Outcome::Refused(AlreadyWatched)`); `CLAUDE.md` "list_cache has one owner" | confirmed |
| 14 | "Turn on the confirmation toast and every update waits for one click on the desktop." | `src-tauri/src/alerts/notify.rs` action toast (Windows `tauri_winrt_notification` button, Linux `notify-rust` action); mobile returns "action toasts are desktop-only"; setting "Ask before updating" in `src/pages/settings/DetectionPane.tsx` | confirmed, desktop only (stated) |
| 15 | Flow: release-name parser, fuzzy matcher, relations data for season splits and redirects | `src-tauri/src/playback/recognition/parser.rs`, `recognition/matcher.rs`, `src-tauri/src/playback/relations.rs` (erengy/anime-relations, cached 7 days) | confirmed |
| 16 | "A receipt with an undo lands in the app" | `src/lib/receipt.ts`, `src/hooks/useListMutations.ts` | confirmed (undo declines for custom lists and advanced scores — the Features row says "ten fields") |
| 17 | "After two thirds of the runtime … or the minutes you set" | `scrobbler.rs` threshold: setting in minutes, else 2/3 of episode length; `src/i18n/en.ts` "0 = automatic (two thirds of the episode length)" | confirmed |
| 18 | "A pause defers, it does not cancel" | `CLAUDE.md` note measured 2026-09-03 with mpv; `scrobbler.rs` `EMPTY_TICK_GRACE` | confirmed |
| 19 | "An unclear season is yours to settle … offers the sequels" | `CLAUDE.md` "The season is inert for matching unless the title carries it"; `scrobbler.rs` `BlockReason::UnknownSeason`; the match picker offers sequels | confirmed |
| 20 | Players: mpv, VLC, MPC-HC, MPC-BE, PotPlayer, SMPlayer | `src-tauri/src/playback/detection/profiles.rs` | confirmed |
| 21 | Browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Brave, Opera, Vivaldi, Zen, LibreWolf, Waterfox, Helium | `profiles.rs` | confirmed |
| 22 | Streaming sites: Bilibili, ADN; manga sites: MANGA Plus, "Any site, for what you are reading" | `profiles.rs` `SITES`, `MANGA_MARKERS` and `match_site`, the `bilibili_names_series_and_episode` and `adn_cuts_its_dub_list` tests; tab titles measured 2026-10-05 (`CLAUDE.md`). Any other site: `detection/browser.rs` `chapter_tab` and `scrobbler.rs` `generic_refusal`, held by `a_chapter_tab_of_a_series_being_read_is_detected`, `a_chapter_page_of_an_unrelated_series_is_not` and `a_jump_past_the_next_chapters_is_not_detected`; the unofficial readers left the list on 2026-10-07 by the maintainer's call, and the rule names no site. Netflix left the list that day, since its tab reads only "Netflix"; Crunchyroll followed on 2026-10-06 by the maintainer's call, since its German watch page named no episode number. Its profile stays for titles that spell one | confirmed |
| 23 | "Windows has all of these. Linux reads media sessions, mpv and Jellyfin, and no window titles; Android reads Jellyfin." | `detection/mod.rs` non-Windows `enumerate_windows` returns empty ("Wayland forbids…"); `mpv_ipc.rs` mobile stub; `src/pages/Settings.tsx` `ANDROID_DESKTOP_ONLY` | confirmed |
| 24 | The Now Playing screenshot: "Katanagatari … E3 … Progress will update in 32 min 56 s" | captured 2026-10-03 on the rig (1.32.8.771) with a real mpv window (`--force-media-title`) and confirmation on; `karasu.log` shows the match and the session, and no write | confirmed (real capture) |

## Local library

| # | Claim | Evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 25 | "Up to 20,000 files, six levels deep" | `src-tauri/src/library.rs` `MAX_FILES = 20_000`, `MAX_DEPTH = 6` | confirmed |
| 26 | Match reads exact / close / yours | `library.rs` score 1.0 exact short-circuit; `CLAUDE.md` schema v8/v9 | confirmed |
| 27 | "The first episode past your progress"; "Plays it in your default player, or in mpv if you point Karasu at it" | `library.rs` `play_next`, `open_path` (mpv binary if configured, else the OS opener) | confirmed |
| 28 | Corrections stick; seasons can be split (Karasu proposes the split through `plan_redirect`, the user confirms it — relations only hint, `library.rs`); unplaced titles get a suggestion applied only when confirmed | `CLAUDE.md` schema v9 (`library_override` never cleared by a scan), v11 (`library_redirect`), v10 (`library_suggestion`); `src-tauri/src/identify.rs` | confirmed |
| 29 | "Karasu never downloads anything." | `CLAUDE.md` "Explicitly rejected": RSS/torrent feeds and anything piracy-adjacent | confirmed |

## Offline

| # | Claim | Evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 30 | List cached in a local SQLite database | `src-tauri/src/db.rs` `list_cache` | confirmed |
| 31 | Offline detail page with a working +1 for a title on your list; nothing for one that is not | `src/components/media/OfflineDetail.tsx` | confirmed |
| 32 | Edits queued, per account, inspectable and discardable in Settings, sent in order on return | `db.rs` `offline_queue` with `user_id` (schema v16); `src-tauri/src/commands/list.rs` drain paths; `QueueSection` (defined in `AdvancedPane.tsx`, rendered in the Import & export pane, `src/lib/settingsPanes.ts` `data`) | confirmed |
| 33 | "'Queued' is never 'saved' — the receipt says which" | `CLAUDE.md` invariant "Queued is not success", `Outcome::{Landed, Queued, Refused}`; `useListMutations.ts` receipt text | confirmed |

## Statistics

| # | Claim | Evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 34 | Five tabs: overview, ratings, years, genres and tags, people and studios | `src/pages/Statistics.tsx` | confirmed |
| 35 | Charts drawn by hand in SVG: radar, sunburst, treemap, area, dot plot, gradient bars, heatmaps; no chart library | `src/components/stats/Charts.tsx`, `AreaChart.tsx`, `DotPlot.tsx`, `GradientBars.tsx`, `Heatmap.tsx`, `DayHeatmap.tsx`; `CLAUDE.md` Charts note | confirmed |

| 38 | "Half of it is drawn from the list Karasu already holds — the sunburst, your watch time, your scores against the crowd — and the rest is AniList's own statistics, fetched once and kept for half an hour" | `src/pages/Statistics.tsx`: the sunburst, watch time and `ScoreDeltaSummary` come from the cached `mediaList`; the ratings, years, genres and people tabs come from `useQuery` → `userStatistics` (`USER_STATS_QUERY` in `src/api/queries.ts`, `staleTime` 30 min in memory, plus the on-disk query cache's one-hour TTL for a reopened app); local mode is cache-only (`LocalStatistics`). The earlier wording "costs no requests and is there offline too" was wrong and was replaced on 2026-09-06 | confirmed |

## Features

|---|---|---|---|
| 39 | Scores in the account's format: 100-point, 10-point with or without decimals, five stars, three smileys | `src/lib/scoreFormat.ts`; `CLAUDE.md` "Scores live in the account's scoreFormat, end to end" | confirmed |

| 51 | Activity feed, profiles with follow and affinity, forum threads and comments with permalinks (`src/lib/threadJump.ts`, `?comment=`), text posts, likes, replies; character, staff and studio pages (`src/app/App.tsx` routes, `src/pages/Person.tsx`) | `src/api/social.ts`; `src/pages/Social.tsx`, `UserProfile.tsx`, `Forum.tsx`, `Thread.tsx`; `src/lib/affinity.ts` | confirmed |
| 52 | "Nothing social is kept on your machine … every further page is a button rather than a scroll" | `CLAUDE.md` "No local activity store", "Paging is a button, never a scroll" | confirmed |
| 53 | Discord: off until switched on; title, episode/chapter, timer; buttons to the project and to the title on AniList (`discord.rs` button constants); never your AniList name; filtered titles never broadcast | `src-tauri/src/discord.rs` (`discord_enabled == "1"`, nothing seeds it; payload fields; content-filter guard) | confirmed |
| 54 | Export MAL XML and JSON in either mode; import into a local list; daily local backup on by default; portable mode | `src/pages/settings/AdvancedPane.tsx` (export both modes, import local only); `src-tauri/src/backups.rs` (`read_enabled` default on, 7 kept); `src-tauri/src/portable.rs` | confirmed |

| 64 | Updates: Stable channel by default, checked once a day; Nightly one switch away in Settings → Desktop → Updates | `commands/update.rs` `stored_channel` default `stable` (schema v19 seeds `prerelease` for existing installs), `UPDATE_CHECK_THROTTLE_MS`; `src/pages/settings/AdvancedPane.tsx` `UpdatesSection` rendered in the Desktop pane (on Android in the Account pane, `Settings.tsx` `ANDROID_EXTRA_SECTIONS`) | confirmed |

| 66 | Token kept in the OS credential store; an encrypted file in portable mode; the Android Keystore; never handed back to the web view (the browser hand-off is `src/hooks/useAniListLogin.ts` `openUrl`; the manual fallback in `commands/auth.rs` `anilist_connect` takes a pasted token once, and nothing returns it — `anilist_session` answers the cached viewer only) | `src-tauri/src/anilist/auth.rs` (keyring; DPAPI/XChaCha20 portable files); `src-tauri/src/keystore.rs`; `CLAUDE.md` hard constraint | confirmed |

## Added in the copy review of 2026-09-06

A second pass read every sentence against this table and the app source.
Three sentences were wrong and were rewritten (rows 38, 72 and the meta
description in row 80); the rest below were true but had no row.

| # | Claim | Evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|

| 76 | "Tailwind CSS v4 — one design-token file, the same one this site uses" | `site/scripts/sync-tokens.mjs` generates `tokens.generated.css` from `src/app/index.css`; `CLAUDE.md` "Tokens are generated, never copied" | confirmed |

| 78 | FAQ "Signing in happens on anilist.co in your browser, which hands Karasu a token" | `src/hooks/useAniListLogin.ts` `openUrl`; the paste fallback in `commands/auth.rs` `anilist_connect` for a browser that cannot call back | confirmed |
| 79 | The external links: Discord invite, the two issue templates, "Nightly builds" at `releases/tag/latest`, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, CHANGELOG, LICENSE | `site/src/site.config.ts` against `README.md` (invite), `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml` and `feature_request.yml`, `commands/update.rs` and `release.yml` (the `latest` tag), the four files at the repository root; every link answered 200 on 2026-09-06 | confirmed |

| 82 | Gallery "a capture of the app as it ships"; Features "Each of these is in the current release" | desktop captures of 1.32.8.771 and phone captures of the release APK 1.32.6.769, both 2026-10-03; every feature named is on `main` and in the Nightly, and in the next Stable tag | confirmed |
| 83 | FAQ "Windows has every feature. Android has the list, statistics, notifications, widgets, the social pages and its own updater, but no local library and no tray" | `src/pages/Settings.tsx` hides the Library and Desktop panes on Android; `src-tauri/src/apk_update.rs`; `lib.rs` tray is desktop-only; rows 48, 60 | confirmed |
| 84 | "Right-click a title for everything you can do to it; the palette and the phone's long press offer the same list" | `src/lib/actions.ts` resolves one action list; `src/components/shell/ActionHost.tsx` owns right-click and the 500 ms press and draws `ContextMenu.tsx` or `ActionSheet.tsx`; `CommandPalette.tsx` reads the same resolver (1.12–1.16) | confirmed |
| 85 | Android: "Pull a list down to sync, hold a title for its actions, swipe up from the bar for the palette" | `src/hooks/usePullToSync.ts` + `src/lib/pullToSync.ts`; row 84; `src/components/shell/BottomBar.tsx` + `src/lib/navSwipe.ts`; measured on the maintainer's phone on 2026-09-19 (PR #27) | confirmed |
| 86 | Android "updates itself: the APK for your device downloads over Wi-Fi and opens the installer when you tap" | `src-tauri/src/apk_update.rs` (metered network refused unless `apk_download_metered`, sha256 and signing-certificate checks), `UpdateInstaller.kt`, `src/pages/About.tsx` `ApkUpdatePanel`, the bell row, the start prompt (1.11) | confirmed |

## Screenshots

All twenty-two are captures on the maintainer's account: desktop from the
isolated rig at 1440×900, rendered at 2×, of build 1.32.8.771; phone from the
release APK of 1.32.6.769 over adb; both on 2026-10-03. The local library
shows a folder of empty files named like clean releases. The Now Playing
capture is a real mpv window under `--force-media-title`. Nothing is
composited or edited beyond resizing and encoding. Approved by the maintainer
on 2026-09-06; the 1.10.6 set on 2026-09-19; the 1.32 set on 2026-10-03.
